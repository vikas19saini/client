                                            As is the case with many sites, when you visit our site and complete a registration form, we
                                            will place a "cookie" on your computer, which helps us identify you more quickly when you
                                            return. We will not use "cookies" or other devices to follow your click stream on the
                                            Internet generally, but will use them, and other devices, to determine which pages or

                                        <p>Most browsers permit you to refuse to accept a "cookie" offered by a Web site. You will not

                                        but your transactions through this Web site may be delayed due to the time it takes you to
                           re-enter basic information necessary to complete a transaction.</p>
